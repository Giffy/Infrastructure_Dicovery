# Infrastructure Discovery

Puspose of this repository is to provide a collection of scripts to help in infrastructure discovery tasks using bash and python scripts 

These scripts aim to simplify the process of discovering and mapping out an organization's IT infrastructure. With the increasing complexity of modern IT systems, it is becoming more challenging to keep track of all the devices, applications, and services that make up an organization's infrastructure. These scripts provide a way to automate some of the tasks involved in infrastructure discovery, making it easier to keep track of the IT environment.

The repository contains a range of scripts that can be used for different types of infrastructure discovery tasks. For example, there are scripts that can scan a network for open ports and identify the services running on each port. Other scripts can perform DNS lookups to identify all the domain names associated with an IP address or a range of IP addresses. There are also scripts that can crawl a website to identify all the links and pages on the site.

The scripts are designed to be easy to use and can be run from the command line. They can be customized to suit specific requirements, and the code is well-documented to make it easy to understand and modify.

By using these scripts, IT professionals can gain a better understanding of their organization's IT infrastructure, identify potential security vulnerabilities, and ensure that their systems are running efficiently. The scripts can also be used as part of a regular auditing process to ensure that the infrastructure is up-to-date and meets industry best practices. Overall, this repository provides a valuable resource for anyone involved in IT infrastructure management and security.
